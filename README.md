# Data-analysis-COVID-19

The way COVID-19 has spread across the various nations over the globe, there are many factors associated with it that give a lot of useful information about it. 

This repository contains few important datasets that are necessary in the analysis of COVID-19 spread.# Data-analysis-COVID-19
This is an attempt to establish a relationship between the infection of coronavirus and the Happiness index of the nation.

We always believe that the data is “same”, only the “inference” we make out of it makes the difference.

The initiative is to connect the dots that appear to be similar but hard to bring together.

‘COVID-19 data set’ and ‘happiness report’ analysis are the 2 datasets that will be considered. 

The work has been done with COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consists of the data related to cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country. Also we have another dataset consisting of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe. We are going to merge these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.

The relation derived at the end proves that there lies a proportion to the spread of the infection due to coronavirus and developed nations.
